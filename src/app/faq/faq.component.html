<p>What is Air Selling, and why would anyone want to buy air?</p>
<p>
  Air Selling is the world's premier purveyor of the finest quality air. Our
  products are carefully sourced from the most exotic locations on earth, and
  are sure to bring a breath of fresh air into your life. Why would anyone want
  to buy air, you ask? Well, why not? It's a fun and unique way to add a little
  laughter and joy to your day.
</p>

<p>Is your air gluten-free?</p>
<p>
  Yes, all of our air is gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free. It's also free
  of any other allergens, as far as we know.
</p>

<p>Can I use your air to fill my tires?</p>
<p>
  While our air is of the highest quality, we don't recommend using it to fill
  your tires. It's best enjoyed in its natural state, either by breathing it in
  or keeping it in a jar for display.
</p>

<p>Is your air organic?</p>
<p>
  Our air is 100% organic, and is sustainably sourced from the purest locations
  around the world. We take pride in offering the most eco-friendly air on the
  market.
</p>

<p>Can I mix your air with other air?</p>
<p>
  We don't recommend mixing our air with any other air, as it may dilute the
  purity and uniqueness of our product. Our air is best enjoyed on its own, just
  like you are.
</p>

<p>Can I return my air if I don't like the smell?</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns based on smell preferences. Our air is
  sold as-is, and the scents are purely subjective. However, if you receive a
  defective or damaged product, please contact us and we'll be happy to assist
  you.
</p>

<p>Do you offer air fresheners?</p>
<p>
  Yes, we do offer air fresheners in some of our more popular scents, such as
  Grandpa's Breath and Unicorn Farts. These are great for freshening up your car
  or living space. Just don't blame us if your guests start asking where the
  lovely smell is coming from.
</p>

<p>How long does your air last?</p>
<p>
  Our air is guaranteed to last for at least one breath. After that, we cannot
  guarantee the quality or purity of the air. But don't worry, we have plenty
  more where that came from.
