  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <h3>What is Air Selling, and why would anyone want to buy air?</h3>
  <p>
    Air Selling is the world's premier purveyor of the finest quality air. Our
    products are carefully sourced from the most exotic locations on earth, and
    are sure to bring a breath of fresh air into your life. Why would anyone
    want to buy air, you ask? Well, why not? It's a fun and unique way to add a
    little laughter and joy to your day.
  </p>

  <h3>Is your air gluten-free?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, all of our air is gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free. It's also free
    of any other allergens, as far as we know.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I use your air to fill my tires?</h3>
  <p>
    While our air is of the highest quality, we don't recommend using it to fill
    your tires. It's best enjoyed in its natural state, either by breathing it
    in or keeping it in a jar for display.
  </p>

  <h3>Is your air organic?</h3>
  <p>
    Our air is 100% organic, and is sustainably sourced from the purest
    locations around the world. We take pride in offering the most eco-friendly
    air on the market.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I mix your air with other air?</h3>
  <p>
    We don't recommend mixing our air with any other air, as it may dilute the
    purity and uniqueness of our product. Our air is best enjoyed on its own,
    just like you are.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I return my air if I don't like the smell?</h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns based on smell preferences. Our air
    is sold as-is, and the scents are purely subjective. However, if you receive
    a defective or damaged product, please contact us and we'll be happy to
    assist you.
  </p>

  <h3>Do you offer air fresheners?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, we do offer air fresheners in some of our more popular scents, such as
    Grandpa's Breath and Unicorn Farts. These are great for freshening up your
    car or living space. Just don't blame us if your guests start asking where
    the lovely smell is coming from.
  </p>

  <h3>How long does your air last?</h3>
  <p>
    Our air is guaranteed to last for at least one breath. After that, we cannot
    guarantee the quality or purity of the air. But don't worry, we have plenty
    more where that came from.
